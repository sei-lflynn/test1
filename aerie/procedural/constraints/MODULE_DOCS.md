# Module Constraints

This library provides basic tools for creating constraints, based on the timeline library.
To define a constraint, just create a class that implements the Constraint interface.
Then, follow the tutorial documentation (TODO: link to tutorial documentation once written)
to package and upload your constraint to Aerie.
