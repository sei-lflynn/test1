comment on table merlin.simulation_extent is e''
  'Tracks the progress of a simulation as the latest achieved offset from the simulation start time. \n'
  'This is expected to be an update-heavy table, so it is to be kept compact to maximize the likelihood of HOT updates and minimize bloat \n'
  'The data in this table is not particularly valuable once a simulation has completed, and can be cleared out periodically';
